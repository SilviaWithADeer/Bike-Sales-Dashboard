# Bike-Sales-Dashboard

## A Macro Enabled Excel Dashboard that analizes the data for bike sales.

This project was made in order to analize sale date for epople byuing bikes. 
It does the following: 

* Saves the raw date in a separate Excel Sheet: bike_buyers and uses a copy of the date to create the project: Working sheet
* Cleans and formats data: text, dates, numbers
* Changes values in order to be better readable for the user that is accesing the Dashboard 
* Creates an Age Bracket column that groups customers acording to their ages
* Creates Excel Sheet: Pivot Table where the pivots and charts are created
* Data is analized according to different customer criteria in relation to where they bought the bike or not: income and gender, commute to work and age brackets.
* The charts are then used in the dashboard, which slisers included in order to future filter data
* The last step is to add a Clear All Filters button with a Macro attached.
