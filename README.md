## Excel Dashboard for Analyzing Bike Sales Data (Macro-Enabled)

This project features a macro-enabled Excel dashboard designed to analyze bike sales data and provide insights into customer purchasing behavior.

What it does:

* Stores the raw data in a separate Excel Sheet: bike_buyers and works with a copy of it: Working sheet
* Cleans and formats data (text, dates, numbers)
* Makes values easier to read for the user that is accesing the Dashboard (ex: "M" in the Gender column is changed to "Male" and "M" in the Marital Status column is changed to "Married")
* Creates an Age Bracket column that groups customers acording to their ages
* Analyzes data based on whether someone bought a bike, looking at 1. income and gender, 2. commute distance, and 3. age
* Uses pivot tables and charts in a sheet called: Pivot Table
* Builds a dashboard with slicers for filtering in the sheet: Dashboard
* Includes a "Clear All" button, powered by a Macro, that clears all applied filters.
